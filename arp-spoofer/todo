///This is about learning C networking and hands on experience with lower network layers


1. Learn about C sockets
2. Build ARP Spam mechanics
3. Look into intercepting HTML/CSS traffic
4. Manipulate traffic and forward it

Lets say we want to spoof IP address "A".
We listen to incoming packets and when some PC "B" broadcasts an ARP request for IP address A, we start spamming the fake 
ARP replies to "B". We do this with every PC that request IP address A.


1. Write some clean code that:
	1.1 Finds my MAC address and interface index
	1.2 Sets up ethernet header and arp header as much as possible:

 ETH HEADER:
		[***dst mac addr***][my mac addr][eth type: ARP]

 ARP HEADER:
 		[hw type: eth][prot type: IP][hw size: 6][prot size: 4][op code: 2(reply)][my mac addr][spoofed IP addr][***dst mac adr***][***dst IP addr***]


 [***XXXXXXX***] -> means, to be filled in later.



2. Write code that listens to incoming packets and:
	2.1 If packet is an ARP request from "B" for spoofed IP:
		2.1.1 Replace [***dst mac addr***] with B's MAC in ETH and ARP HEADERS
		2.1.2 Replace [***dst IP addr***] with B's IP in ARP HEADER
		2.1.3 Spam the fake ARP reply every x seconds until program stops.
