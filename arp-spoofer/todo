Lets say we want to spoof IP address "A".
We listen to incoming packets and when some PC "B" broadcasts an ARP request for IP address A, we start spamming the fake 
ARP replies to "B". We do this with every PC that request IP address A.


1. Write some clean code that:
	1.1 Finds my MAC address and interface index
	1.2 populates the sockaddr_ll struct correctly so we have a proper ethernet header
    1.3 Sets up the ARP header as much as possible:
    	1.3.1 Hardware type, Protocol type, hardware addr len, prot addr len, OPCODE (reply),
    	 		and Source MAC Address (ours) and Source IP address (The one we are spoofing, "A")



2. Write code that listens to incoming packets and:
	2.1 When an ARP request for IP "A" comes in from PC "B", plug in B's IP and MAC into the prepared msg and start spamming
	2.2 Do this for all ARP request for IP "A"
